 * IMPORTANT: this is a UX convenience, not the real security boundary.
 * Hiding a route here just stops a logged-in student from *seeing* the
 * instructor dashboard shell — it does nothing to stop someone from
 * calling the API directly. The actual enforcement is server-side, in
 * Django's permission classes (see apps/accounts/permissions.py and the
 * module-locking checks in apps/courses/views.py). Never rely on this
 * component alone to protect anything.

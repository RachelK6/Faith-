# Microsoft SQL Server Setup — Optimum ERP LMS

Microsoft SQL Server is the only supported database for development and production. Django migrations are provider-neutral and use the custom `config.mssql` backend.

## Local setup

1. Install SQL Server or use an existing reachable SQL Server instance.
2. Install Microsoft ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server on the machine running Django.
3. Copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env` and configure:

   ```text
   MSSQL_DB_NAME=optimum_erp_lms
   MSSQL_DB_USER=<application login>
   MSSQL_DB_PASSWORD=<secret>
   MSSQL_DB_HOST=localhost
   MSSQL_DB_PORT=1433
   MSSQL_ODBC_DRIVER=ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server
   MSSQL_EXTRA_PARAMS=Encrypt=yes;TrustServerCertificate=yes;
   ```

4. Ensure the database exists and the application login can create/update objects in its schema.
5. From `backend/`, run `python manage.py check`, `python manage.py migrate`, then `python manage.py createsuperuser`.

For trusted certificates, use `TrustServerCertificate=no`. Keep certificate validation enabled in production.

## Docker

Set `MSSQL_DB_HOST` in `backend/.env.docker`. `host.docker.internal` reaches SQL Server on the Docker host; remote SQL Server instances should use their private hostname. SQL Server remains outside the Compose stack and its TCP port is not published by this project.

```powershell
Copy-Item backend/.env.docker.example backend/.env.docker
$env:SANDBOX_TOKEN = (python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))")
docker compose up --build -d
docker compose exec backend python manage.py migrate
docker compose exec backend python manage.py createsuperuser
```

## Existing SQLite data

Removing SQLite configuration or its file does not import its records into SQL Server. If an existing SQLite file contains users, courses, enrollments, submissions, or progress, back it up and perform a rehearsed data export/import before deleting it. Verify record counts, foreign keys, uploaded-media paths, credentials, and user flows against SQL Server. Keep a rollback backup until the cutover has been accepted.

## Troubleshooting

- **Connection refused/timeouts:** confirm SQL Server TCP/IP is enabled, the server is listening on the configured port, and firewalls allow the backend host.
- **Login failed:** verify the database name and SQL login permissions; do not use `sa` for the application.
- **ODBC driver not found:** install ODBC Driver 18 on the backend host/container and confirm `MSSQL_ODBC_DRIVER` matches its installed name.
- **Certificate errors:** configure the correct CA trust chain. Do not suppress certificate validation in production.
- **Missing tables:** run `python manage.py showmigrations` and the deployment migration job.
